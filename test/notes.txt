figure out how to run test file from command line
double-check the output
    -check accuracy
    -make sure all the ratios are being calculated
create the outcome states
stuff the outcome states to the json
handle name error: if root not in test file
do not count the first character (space)
implement the new ratio 'delta' methodology
    x - for proportions
    -not done yet for avg message 
x  - adjust bursts to catch last one
x - catch initiations regardless of whether sender changes

fixes

zero handling
-if contact is not zero and root is zero-should not force to zero
-new way to do ratios? delta as percent of total
    messages
    characters
    qmarks
    exclams
    media
    words
    initiations


accuracy

YYYY initiations - fix (0/0 vs. 0/1)
YYYY bursts
YYYY response time - 240/60 vs. 240/90

proportions
 x exclams - forced to zero
 x media - forced to zero
 chars - 
    70 vs. 66 for u1
    130 vs. 125 for u2
    probably due to spaces?
 x messages
 x qmarks - forced to zero
 x words 
 x weekdays
 
x response time
x shifts 
x root
x senders
